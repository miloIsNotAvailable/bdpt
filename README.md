to add fucking glad, fuck you it's like in programming everyone's too retarded to make something uniform, every fucking library has to be added eithr manually or with some fucking target subdirectory fucking voodoo magic this language has been around for so long and is used so much one would think you'd have basic shit like this solved already but somehow this turned out to be way too fucking complicated or no one fixes this shit so you can jack yourself off when your shit just works and nobody knows why or how to configure it, mixed with no fucking docs for most libraties should be fuckin illegal, this is all fucking stupid how does nobody see it holy fuck
